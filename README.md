This repository contains a Dockerfile that fails to build due to missing dependencies or incorrect installation commands. The original Dockerfile contains errors that prevent it from installing necessary Python packages. The solution provides a corrected Dockerfile that resolves these issues by explicitly specifying package dependencies and using the correct installation commands. The solution demonstrates proper use of `apt-get` for system-level dependencies and `pip` for Python packages. It is important to ensure that all required packages are specified in the `requirements.txt` file and that the `COPY` commands are correctly ordered. This bug and solution are intended to demonstrate best practices in creating Dockerfiles, especially concerning dependency management.
